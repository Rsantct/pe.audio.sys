# <card jack name>

# ACTUAL ALSA CARD:
jack_options:           -R -d alsa

# =========================  LIMITS  ===========================================

# Max balance setting authorised

# Put here your loudspeaker folder name
loudspeaker: SeasFlat

# Gain dBFS at convolver output to obtain the reference SPL (level = 0.0):

# ========================= STARTUP BEHAVIOR: ==================================
# (i) Leave blank these fields to restore from the last state,
#     or indicate a value to force.
#     Use quotes for string type options (midside, solo, input).

on_init:

    # Put here the common IDSTRING that identifies the XO FIR filters at start up.
    # ie: xo.lo.IDSTRING.pcm  xo.hi.IDSTRING.pcm
    xo:     mp

    # Put here the IDSTRING that identifies the DRC FIR filters at start up.
    # ie: drc.L.IDSTRING.pcm  drc.R.IDSTRING.pcm
    drc:    mp_multipV1

    # Put here just whatever the target filename prefix,
    # w/o '_mag.dat' neither '_pha.dat'

    input:              'mpd'


# =================== BEHAVIOR WHEN CHANGE INPUT:  =============================
# (i) Leave blank these fields or indicate a value to force.
#     Use quotes for string type options (midside and solo).

on_change_input:
    bass:               0.0

    solo:               'off'


# ============================  SOURCES  =======================================
# (i)
#     - If capture_ports here are named 'xxxxloop', then the preamp will
#       automagically spawn them for the sources can connect into. Obviously the
#       sources must be configured accordingly.
#
#     - xo, drc fields are optional, you may want minimum phase FIRs for video.
#
#     - loudness_ref field is optional and overrides the on_change_input behavior.
