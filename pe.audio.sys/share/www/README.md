This folder hosts the web page that manages your pe.audio.sys, for instance from your smartphone, tablet or PC web browser. 

**(i)** Please mind that an **HTML5** capable browser is needed.


## Web page layouts:

You can browse two web page flavours depending on your device usage preference:

- `index.html` is designed for general use cases, usually smartphones operated vertically.

- `index_big.html` has big characters to improve readability from far, for instance when browsing from a tablet placed on a shelf.


## Configure the web page behavior

Some options can be configured inside **`config.yml`**:

- Command to run when the reboot button is pressed.
- Show or hide the macro buttons array at startup.
- The standard input selector can become an user's macro selector.
- Enable download EQ graph images from the server.

Downloading the Brutefir EQ graph on runtime increases the refreshing bandwidth only when the `[G]`raphics button toggles to display it.

## HTTP Server configuration: Apache+PHP or Node.js

It is possible to use two server side backend flavours:

- **Apache+PHP (system wide service)**
- **Node.js (user space service)**

The only needed configuration (1) has to be done inside the `clientside.js` file:

     Set URL_PREFIX ='/' if you use the provided peasys_node.js server script,
     or set it '/functions.php' if you use Apache+PHP at server side.
     
(1) Above changes are automatically made when running the `tmp/uptade_peaudiosys.sh` installing script.

Last, the **HTTP port** needs to be configured, as appropriate:

- inside your Apache's `sites-available/` configuration, 
- or inside the `share/www/peaudio_node.js` file, for instance `NODEJS_PORT = 8080;` 


## HTTP server launcher

If you use **Apache + PHP**, you need to set properly a `sites-available/` file under your system wide Apache2 configuration. See [FIRtro's Wiki](https://github.com/AudioHumLab/FIRtro/wiki/04a-Instalación-de-Linux-y-paquetes-de-SW#6-página-web-de-control-remoto-opcional-pero-recomendable).

If you prefer to run **Node.js** as server side backend, you need to run Node.js under your user space:

- Add `- node_web_server.py` under the `scripts:` section inside `config.yml`

- Or you can launch Node.js at startup through by adding a line inside your system `/etc/rc.local` file as follows:

    `su -l YourUser -c "node /home/YourUser/pe.audio.sys/share/www/peasys_node.js"`


## Screenshots
First screenshot shows advanced controls (hidden by default, toggled by the gear button)

When 'iradio' or 'istreams' input, it appears an url link button [ &#9901; ] to the user to enter an url stream address to be played
