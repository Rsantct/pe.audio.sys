# please see details at pe.audio.sys/pe.audio.sys/doc

#
# NOTICE:
# If your recording time is greater than ~ 6 hours, the resulting wav file
# header cannot suport the actual file size, so wav readers will ignore
# recorded samples beyond ~ 4 Gb.
#
# A workaround is to ignore the wav header. You can use Audacity then import
# the radio_xxxx.wav as RAW DATA (signed 16 bit PCM default endianness 2 ch 48 KHz)
#


# Put here the channel name as per ~/.mplayer/channels.conf
#
channel="Radio Clasica HQ A52"


# 'Radio Clasica HD A52' is codified in Dolby Digital AC-3 (5.1 channels 48KHz/float32)
#  It only carries FL and FR channels with volume reduced about 12 dB.
#  Mplayer will convert to 16 bit in order to reduce the recorded file size,
#  also will apply a volume gain (12 dB should work fine, but 9 dB is safer)
#
dB_gain=9
